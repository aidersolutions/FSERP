##FSERP:
FSERP is an [ERP] based on [Tryton] and [Proteus] as backend library with Ui designed on [Pyside]
### Version:
1.0
### Notes:

- I have added all the files includeing IDE files, just to be secure even if the local copy is lost i can use this to work on.


### Structure:

>This is just a basic structure not the final version

The backend files have "_tryton.py" as a substring in the file name.

The front end lies are normal ".py" files without the "_tryton" substring.

This structure helps us to define each task as a separate module.

### Todo's:

- Write Tests
- Work on memory and processing speed optimization
- Work on APIs

### Support:
